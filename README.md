# Face Detection Project

This project includes two scripts for face detection using OpenCV:
1. **Live Face Detection**: Detects faces in real-time using a webcam.
2. **Image Face Detection**: Detects faces from a static image.

## 1. Live Face Detection

This script captures video from the webcam and detects faces in real-time.

### Usage

1. Ensure you have OpenCV installed. You can install it using:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
